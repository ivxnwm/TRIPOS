# Groups

## Basics

**Definition 1.1** Binary operation
> A binary operation on a set $X$ is a function $*: X \times X \to X$.

**Definition 1.2** Group
> A group is a triple $(G, *, e)$ where
> * $G$ is a set,
> * $*$ is a binary operation on $G$
> * $e \in G$
> 
> satisfying 4 axioms:
> * closure :  $\forall a, b \in G$, $a * b \in G$
> * associativity : $\forall a, b, c \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$
> * (right) identity : $\forall a \in G$, $a * e = a$
> * (right) inverses : $\forall a \in G$, $\exists b \in G$ such that $a * b = e$

**Proposition 1.3**
> Let $(G, *, e)$ be a group, let $a, b, b', e' \in G$. Then:
> * Right inverses are left inverses: $a * b = e \implies b * a = e$
> * Right identity is left identity: $e * a = a$
> * Inverses are unique: if $a * b = e$ and $a * b' = e$ then $b = b'$
> * Identity is unique: $a * e' = a \implies e' = e$
> 
> Remark: We can therefore write $a^{-1}$ for the unique inverse of $a$.

**Definition 1.4** Abelian group
> A group $(G, *, e)$ is abelian if $\forall a, b \in G$, $a * b = b * a$.

**Definition 1.5** Order of a group
> The order of a group $(G, *, e)$ is the number of elements of the set $G$, denoted $|G|$ or $\#G$.
> If $|G|<\infty$ then $G$ is finite, otherwise infinite.

**Definition 1.6** Bijection and permutation
> Let $X, Y$ be sets. A bijection is a map $f: X \to Y$ that has an inverse $g: Y \to X$ such that $f \circ g = id_Y$
> and $g \circ f = id_X$.
> 
> A bijection $f: X \to X$ is called a permutation of $X$.

**Definition 1.7** Symmetric group
> The symmetric group, $Sym(X)$, is the group of all permutations of a set $X$ under composition.
> If $X=\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, we write $S_n$ for $Sym(X)$.

**Definition 1.8** Subgroup
> Let $G$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$. Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if:
> * $e \in H$
> * $\forall a, b \in H$, $a * b \in H$
> * $\forall a \in H$, $a^{-1} \in H$
> 
> We write $H \leq G$.
> 
> Remarks:
> * if $H \leq G$ then $H$ is a group
> * every group is a subgroup of itself
> * for any group $G$, $1_G=\{e_G\} \leq G$ is called the trivial subgroup
> * other subgroups are called proper subgroups

**Proposition 1.9**
> If $H\leq \mathbb{Z}$ then $H = n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Definition 1.10** Generators
> Let $X \subseteq G$, $G$ is a group.
> 
> $<X> = \bigcap_{X \subseteq H \leq G} H$ is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $X$.
